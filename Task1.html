    <img src="img/boat.jpg" alt="img" width="400" height="350" />
    <p>
      Lalakhal, one of the most popular tourist destinations, is situated in
      Jaintapur Upazila, next to the Tamabil road, 35 kilometres from Sylhet.
      The tranquillity of nature can be experienced while exploring Lalakhal's
      unique scenery while participating in various recreational activities. The
      origin of the name 'Lalakhal' is a mysterious one. In Bengali, 'Lalak'
      means red or redness, while 'Khal' means a canal or river. The name
      Lalakhal comes from the scarlet hue that the river Shari's water takes on
      in the winter. During winter, water from the hills carries red silt and
      other sediments downstream, eventually settling on the riverbank. As a
      result, the water in Lalakhal takes on a reddish tint resembling the
      colour 'Lal' (red), which is how the place got its name.
